He had 126 receptions during his career and played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.<br/><br/>Regarded as a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Seferian-Jenkins was ranked as the second-ranked tight end prospect in his class, behind Nick O'Leary and ahead of Jace Amaro. He chose his home-state school, The University of Washington, over offers from Alabama, Miami (FL), Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Southern California, and Texas because Washington was the only big school to offer him the opportunity to play both basketball and football.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>As a true freshman in the 2011 season, Seferian-Jenkins started 10 of 13 games and had 41 receptions for 538 yards and six touchdowns.
