            Barnaby Phillips (born 1968) is an historian and conservationist. He is Senior Communications Adviser for the Elephant Protection Initiative (EPI), working to shut down the ivory trade and save Africa's elephants. Previously, he worked as a television and radio correspondent. He was a Senior Correspondent for Al Jazeera English, the 24-hour international television news channel based in Doha in Qatar, and owned by the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network. He was based in the Greek capital of Athens, and later moved to Al Jazeera's main European base in London. He was formerly with the BBC for 15 years and from 2001 was its Southern Africa Correspondent. He has extensive experience in several continents, and reported on major news stories from 1991-2018. His first book, Another Man's War, was published in September 2014. His second book, Loot; Britain and the Benin Bronzes was published in 2021. It tells the story of the Benin Empire (located in modern-day Nigeria), how its treasures were looted in 1897 by the British military, what happened to them next, and examines the current debate about restitution.
