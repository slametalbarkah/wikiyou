            Goro Akechi (Japanese: 明智 吾郎, Hepburn: Akechi Gorō), who uses the code name Crow (クロウ, Kurō), is a fictional character and the secondary antagonist of the 2016 video game Persona 5, which is the sixth installment of the Persona series. A third year high school detective nicknamed "The Second Coming of the Detective Prince", Akechi opposes the Phantom Thieves' actions and becomes both a rival and foil to Joker, the group's leader.<br/><br/>Created by Shigenori Soejima, Akechi was developed to be a mysterious detective and Joker's opposite. His name and character are in reference to the fictional character Kogoro Akechi created by Edogawa Ranpo, specifically with his portrayal as a celebrity detective mirroring the original Akechi's role in Ranpo's works. Besides printed and animated versions of the series, he has also been featured in the spin-offs Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth. For Persona 5 Royal, his characterization was further explored in order to appeal more to players. He is voiced by Sōichirō Hoshi in Japanese and Robbie Daymond in English.<br/><br/>Initial critical reception towards his character in both the game and the anime was mixed, despite ranking high on official character polls. Because of this, Akechi was further explored in Royal, and upon its release critics found him to be more likable due to Atlus handling him in a different fashion from his original version.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Development ==<br/><br/>Akechi's character design was created by Shigenori Soejima.
