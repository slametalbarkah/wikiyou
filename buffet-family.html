            The Buffet family was a family of French musical instrument makers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Denis Buffet-Auger ==<br/><br/>Denis Buffet-Auger, born Denis Buffet, was born 28 July 1783 in La Couture, near Dreux into a family of woodturners.  He became known as Buffet-Auger after his marriage to Marie-Anne Auger.  In 1825 he set up a workshop in Paris making instruments, a business that was to become the Buffet Crampon company, still in operation and one of the foremost manufacturers of woodwind instruments. Jean Louis Buffet was his son.  Denis Buffet-Auger died on 24 Sep 1841 in Paris.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Auguste Buffet jeune ==<br/><br/>Auguste Buffet jeune (full name Louis-Auguste Buffet) was born 6 August 1789 in La Couture, a younger brother of Denis Buffet-Auger.  Auguste was making musical instruments in La Couture by 1813, but by 1830 had moved his workshop to Paris.  In the 1830s he designed and built two new bass clarinets, developed an improved Boehm system flute (with flutist Victor Coche), and, with H.E. Klosé, invented the so-called Boehm system clarinet, the system still most commonly in use outside of Germany, Austria, and Russia for clarinets.  In the early 1840s, with P.J.R. Soler, he developed a Boehm system oboe; this, however, was less successful.
