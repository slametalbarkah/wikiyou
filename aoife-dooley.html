            Aoife Dooley (born 14 April 1991), is an Irish writer, illustrator, comedian and graphic designer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>A North Dubliner, Dooley has lived in Ballymun and Coolock for most of her life. Her father left when she was young and her mother remarried. She has a younger sister. Dooley's mother died when she was twenty two and although she did regain a relationship with her father, he died in 2017. Dooley was diagnosed as autistic in 2018 which she has credited with allowing her to feel more like herself and then include the awareness and acceptance into her work.<br/><br/>She studied in Dublin Institute of Technology, she also studied graphic design in Colaiste Dhulaigh. Her books and illustrations are based on everyday observations of life in Dublin. Her illustrations (which are based on her books) have been turned into an animated TV series for RTÉ starring Al Foran, Emmet Kirwan, Jen Hatton and Enya Martin. Dooley also performs live and has appeared at Electric Picnic and Vodafone Comedy Festival.
