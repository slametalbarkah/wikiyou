            Admiralty Football Club, also commonly known as Admiralty FC, is a football club which plays in the Division 2 of the Singapore Football League, the third tier of football in Singapore.<br/><br/>The club last played in the 2019 season of the National Football League Division 2. They were relegated after finishing 3rd in the bottom tier (11th overall).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Admiralty FC started in 1987 as a participant in the Sembawang Group League, a mini-league organized by the Football Association of Singapore which involved amateur clubs based in the Sembawang area in the 1980s. During its time in the Sembawang Group League, Admiralty FC often played against Delhi Juniors, which was the original name of Woodlands Wellington before it changed its name to Wellington FC in 1998.<br/><br/>In 1988, Admiralty FC finished as one of the top two teams in the Island-Wide League and was set to be promoted to the Division 2 of the Singapore Football League (SFL). Its promotion was challenged by Gillman FC who seek to nullify a match between Admiralty FC and Shelford United, which Admiralty FC won 5–0. FAS rejected the challenge and Admiralty FC was successfully promoted to the SFL.<br/><br/>With only two years of participation, Admiralty FC was made an official football club in 1989 to compete in the SFL and it played the majority of its home games at the Yio Chu Kang stadium.<br/><br/>Nasiruddin Sawardi and Fahmie Abdullah were two other ex-Singapore internationals who featured for Admiralty in the early nineties.<br/><br/>Admiralty FC came under the limelight in February 2012 when its management announced the appointment of former Woodlands Wellington team manager and Tampines Rovers Director of Operations R. Vengadasalam as their team manager.
