            Frank Rudolph Crosswaith (July 16, 1892 – June 17, 1965) was a West Indian-born American Socialist politician, activist and trade union organizer in New York City who founded and chaired the Negro Labor Committee from 1935 until his death in 1965. He was also appointed the first black member of the New York City Housing Authority, serving from 1942 to 1958.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Frank R. Crosswaith was born on July 16, 1892, in Frederiksted, St. Croix, Danish West Indies (the island was sold to the United States in 1917 and became part of the U.S. Virgin Islands).  His parents were William I. Crosswaith and Anne Eliza Crosswaith.  He emigrated to the United States in his teens. While finishing high school, he worked as an elevator operator, porter and garment worker. He joined the elevator operators' union and when he finished high school, he won a scholarship from the socialist The Jewish Daily Forward to attend the Rand School of Social Science, an educational institute in New York City associated with the Socialist Party of America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Labor career ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Crosswaith founded an organization called the Trade Union Committee for Organizing Negro Workers in 1925, but this work went by the wayside when Crosswaith accepted a position as an organizer for the fledgling Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Crosswaith maintained a long association with union head A. Philip Randolph, serving with him as officers of the Negro Labor Committee in the 1930s and 1940s.
