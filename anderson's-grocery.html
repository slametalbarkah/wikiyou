            Anderson's Grocery, A Family Tradition, more frequently called Anderson's Grocery, is a family-owned grocery store located in Republic, Washington. In 2000 it was one of a few small chain or single location groceries in the US that were a century or more old. The grocery celebrated its centennial year with a "summer of celebration".  The grocery was the recipient of the 2015 Washington Food Industry Association "Excellence in Operations Award".  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swedish immigrant Charles E. Anderson arrived in Republic early in 1900, and by summertime had organized the placement and construction of a grocery on Clark Avenue. He continued to run the grocery until his retirement, training his sons in the business during that time. The second generation of the Anderson family, Charles H., Dean, and John A. Anderson took over running the store from their father Charles E. in 1946, and ran the business through 1976. They were in turn bought out by the third generation Carl, Gary, and John Anderson, who learned from the older Andersons. They operated Anderson's Grocery through the 1980s and started training the next generation of the family.  They  were bought out in 1998 by the fourth generation of the Anderson family Kari Beedle and Julie Padilla, along with long time employee Judee Young.
