            Bernard Alexander Montgomery Grant (17 February 1944 – 8 April 2000) was a British politician who was the Member of Parliament for Tottenham, London, from 1987 to his death in 2000. He was a member of the Labour Party.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years and education ===<br/><br/>Bernie Grant was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, to schoolteacher parents, who in 1963 took up the UK Government's offer to people from the crown colonies to settle in the United Kingdom. In the UK, Grant attended Tottenham Technical College, and went on to take a degree course in Mining Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, but did not graduate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Political career ===<br/><br/>In the mid-1960s, he was, for a period, a member of the Socialist Labour League, led by Gerry Healy. This later became known as the Workers Revolutionary Party. He quickly became a trade union official, and moved into politics, becoming a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Haringey in 1978.<br/><br/>When the Conservative government introduced "rate capping", Grant led the rate-capping rebellion in the borough in 1984. This created division in the local Constituency Labour Party, but through this split, Grant became the Borough of Haringey leader in 1985.<br/><br/>Grant was associated with the Socialist Campaign Group, and spoke out against police racism.
