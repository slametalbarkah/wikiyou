            Dewi Emrys was the pen-name of the west Wales poet David Emrys James (28 May 1881 – 20 September 1952), who wrote in the Welsh language.<br/><br/>He was born at Majorca House in New Quay, Cardiganshire. His father, Thomas Emrys James, was a minister of the Congregational denomination at Llandudno, and Dewi's mother Mary Ellen (née Jones), was the daughter of a sea captain. The family moved to Fishguard, where the Reverend James took on another church, and Dewi Emrys went to the local county school. He became apprenticed to a local newspaper, the County Echo, and was able to continue his training at The Carmarthen Journal when his family moved there in 1896; he soon became editor of its Welsh-language content. In 1903, he moved on to study at the Presbyterian College in Carmarthen, and duly followed his father into the ministry.<br/><br/>For a time he was minister at the Welsh Free Church, Liverpool, then moved to take over churches in Dowlais, Buckley, and Pontypridd. In July 1908 he married Cissie Jenkins, and they subsequently had two sons. In 1915 he became minister of Finsbury Park church in London, but in 1917, during the First World War, he enlisted in the armed forces.<br/><br/>He won the crown at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1926.
