            Jonathan Kipnis (Hebrew: יהונתן קיפניס) is a neuroscientist, immunologist, and professor of pathology and immunology at the Washington University School of Medicine. His lab studies interactions between the immune system and nervous system. He is best known for his lab's discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels in humans and mice, which has impacted research on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Kipnis was born into a Jewish family in Tbilisi, Georgia. His father and maternal grandmother were both physicians and his mother was an academic with a focus in Russian literature and language. Surrounded by physicians, Kipnis knew from a young age that he wanted to cure diseases. He received his undergraduate degree in biology at Tel Aviv University in Ramat Aviv, Israel  in 1998, and his Master's in neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel  in 1999.<br/><br/>For his graduate training, Kipnis remained at the Weizmann Institute of Science. He first worked with Moshe Oren in cancer immunology, but was inspired by   Michal Schwartz,   to pursue a PhD in neuroimmunology. He joined Schwartz's  lab   the year that they discovered the therapeutic benefit of T cells in spinal cord and brain injury, a pioneering finding that began the study of the protective roles of autoimmunity in CNS disease.
