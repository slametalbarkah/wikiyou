            The Guangtong–Chuxiong–Dali railway or Kunchuda railway (Chinese: 昆楚大铁路; pinyin: Kūnchǔdà tiělù) is located in the northern part of Yunnan Province, China. It runs from east to west through Kunming City, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture. It is 328 kilometres (204 mi) long and is part of the China–Myanmar international railway corridor and the western route of the proposed Kunming–Singapore railway. When it was under construction, it was called the "Guangtong–Dali Railway Capacity Expansion and Reconstruction Project" and the "Chengdu–Kunming railway Railway Capacity Expansion and Reconstruction Project: Guangtong–Kunming Double Track". After its completion, it was briefly called the Kun-Guang Railway and was finally named the "Kunchuda railway" (a contraction of Kunming–Chuxiong–Dali railway) when it was in operation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Due to the low technical standards of the Guangtong–Dali railway (Guangda railway), which opened in 1999, only nine pairs of passenger trains can pass through it each day. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Pan-Asian Railway Project ===<br/><br/>The Southeast Asian section of the Trans–Asian railway was originally proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1995 to connect several ASEAN countries. Later, it was responded to by other Asian countries and expanded into a larger plan. Finally, in 2010, the plan was finally implemented after the signing of the "Intergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Railway Network". In the plan, there are three corridors connecting China's southwest region and Southeast Asian countries.
