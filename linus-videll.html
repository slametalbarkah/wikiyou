            Björn Linus Videll (born 5 May 1985) is a Swedish professional ice hockey forward, currently playing with Östersunds IK of the HockeyAllsvenskan (Allsv).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Videll was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the seventh round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, 204th overall, after playing in the Swedish J20 SuperElit with AIK, Brynäs IF and Södertälje SK. Although his youth team is Djurgårdens IF Hockey, he left the Djurgården organization as a 13-year-old and instead joined the AIK organization.<br/><br/>From 2003 to 2011, Videll played primarily with Södertälje SK in the Elitserien (SEL). In the 2010–11 season, Videll scored a career high 20 goals and 43 points, despite Södertälje being relegated to HockeyAllsvenskan after failing to re-qualify in the 2011 Kvalserien. To remain in the Elitserien for the following season, Videll signed a one-year contract to return to AIK for the 2011–12 season. He played 14 games with AIK, scoring 5 goals and 12 points and at that time placing sixth in the scoring league.<br/><br/>But after that, he was sold to Yugra Khanty-Mansiysk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on 24 October 2011 for financial reasons. The main reason for this was that the Swedish Police Authority decided, just one week earlier, that the police should earn money for their efforts during sports events held by joint-stock companies (JSC). This mainly affected the Stockholm clubs Djurgårdens IF as well as AIK. AIK received 3,5 million SEK for selling Videll to Khanty-Mansiysk. The selling of Videll to Khanty-Mansiysk was considered a major loss for AIK, although Videll had at that time been on Khanty-Mansiysk's radar for two years.
