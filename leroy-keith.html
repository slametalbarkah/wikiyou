<h1>Leroy Keith</h1>
            
            Leroy Keith (1907 – July 23, 1959) was an American criminal and serial killer who killed three people in Ohio and New York during robberies. Originally sentenced to death twice in Ohio, he was released on parole and went on to kill two more people before being executed at Sing Sing in 1959.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Murders ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Fred Greist ===<br/><br/>On July 24, 1934, 52-year-old mill worker Fred Greist was sitting in his parked car in front of a movie theater in Warren, Ohio when he was approached by a young man who demanded that he get out of the car. Whilst it is unclear if Greist had protested, when he exited the vehicle, he was shot in the heart and died instantly. In the subsequent investigation, police officers arrested a man named Ernest Baugh, who claimed that the killer had been Leroy Keith, a local man who had previous convictions for auto theft and burglary. According to Baugh, Keith had planned to rob a local store and needed a car when he came across the unfortunate Greist. A short time later, Keith was captured by police officers after they saw him in a car which had been reported stolen in Akron. He was brought to trial, and sentenced to death by Justice Lynn B. Griffith. Keith was later given a new trial, but was again sentenced to death. His lawyers submitted an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, and managed to have their client's conviction reduced to second degree murder and changing his sentence to life imprisonment, which he would serve at the Ohio State Penitentiary.
