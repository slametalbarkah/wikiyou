            Jerzy Waldorff-Preyss of the Nabram coat of arms (4 May 1910 – 29 December 1999) was a Polish media personality, public intellectual, socialite, music critic and music aficionado. He wrote over twenty books, mostly on the subject of classical music and society. Waldorff is known as "the last baron of the Polish People's Republic".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life and education ===<br/><br/>Waldorff was born in Warsaw to a Polish engineer and landowner, Witold Preyss. His family moved first to Kościelna Wieś in the historical Kujawy region and then to Rękawczyn, Greater Poland, where his father bought an estate after World War I. Waldorff spent his childhood there, in a manor house at the end of an avenue bordered with 100-year-old lime trees. He wrote later that the family left the estate and moved back to Warsaw soon after his father's death. <br/><br/>Waldorff spent his childhood in Rękawczyn, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. Later he attended liberal arts schools, including gymnasium in Trzemeszno, Saint Mary Magdalene Gymnasium in Poznań, and eventually graduated from Marcinkowski Gymnasium in Poznań (matura 1928).<br/><br/>He studied law at the University of Poznań, and graduated with a Master of Jurisprudence (M.Jur.) in 1932. Following law school, Waldorff became a trainee solicitor at the Warsaw office of the law firm owned by University of Warsaw's distinguished professor Włodzimierz Kozubski, but abandoned law as a profession before being admitted to the bar.
