            Robert Jay Mathews (January 16, 1953 – December 8, 1984) was an American neo-Nazi terrorist and the leader of The Order, an American white supremacist militant group. He was burned alive during a shootout with approximately 75 federal law enforcement agents who surrounded his house on Whidbey Island, near Freeland, Washington.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and activities ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>Robert Mathews was born in Marfa, Texas, on January 16, 1953, the youngest of three sons born to Johnny and Una Mathews. His father, of Scottish descent, was mayor of the town, and the President of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as a businessman and leader for the local Methodist church. His mother was the town's Cub Scout den mother.<br/><br/>The family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Though he was an average student in grade school, history and politics interested him. At age 11, he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing advocacy group supporting paleoconservatism, anti-communism and limited government. Mathews was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1969.<br/><br/>Mathews formed the Sons of Liberty, an anti-communist militia whose members were mainly Mormon survivalists.
