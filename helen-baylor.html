In 1967/68 she worked with producer Bobby Sanders releasing two singles, "The Richest Girl" and "What About Me Boy", as Little Helen for the Soultown label. In the 1970s she joined hit Broadway musical Hair and followed this period of her career as a session musician for artists that included Captain &amp; Tennille, Les McCann and Rufus.
