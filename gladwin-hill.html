            Gladwin Hill (June 16, 1914, Boston – September 19, 1992, Los Angeles) was an American journalist who was a member of the famed Writing 69th, a group of reporters who trained and flew on bombing missions with the Eighth Air Force during World War II.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>Hill was an alumnus of Harvard University.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Writing 69th group ==<br/><br/>As a member of the group of reporters who were known alternatively, as either the Writing 69th, the Legion of the Doomed, or the Flying Typewriters. Hill trained with the United States Eighth Air Force. The training covered important topics such as high altitude adjustment, weapons, and parachuting. Hill worked for the Associated Press from 1936–1944 and was the AP correspondent assigned to the bomber missions. <br/><br/>Hill flew his first and last bomber mission on February 26, 1943. On that day, one of the planes was carrying reporter Robert Post. That plane was shot down and Post and eight Air Force personnel were killed. Hill described his participation in the mission in his article the next day: "It was thrilling. Yet at the same time it was strangely prosaic in the business-like efficiency with which it was executed."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== After World War II ==<br/><br/>After World War II ended, Hill went to work for the New York Times in their Los Angeles bureau.
