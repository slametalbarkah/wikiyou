<h1>Jaime Ridge</h1>
            
            Jaime Dillon Ridge (born 1993) is a New Zealand fashion blogger and owns the blog Dillon Dot. She has appeared in several Australasian fashion magazines, including Badlands and Denizen.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Ridge was born in Manly, Australia in 1993 but the family returned to New Zealand in 1997 so Matthew could captain the Auckland Warriors. Ridge's parents are New Zealand rugby player and former All Black Matthew Ridge, and Sally Ridge. Growing up, Ridge was often in the public eye and appeared in gossip magazines.<br/><br/>After moving to New Zealand, Ridge was educated at Diocesan School for Girls. In 2010, she moved to Diocesan's brother school, King's College. Ridge also holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Auckland. <br/><br/>Due to financial pressure following her split with Adam Parore, Ridge chose to go directly to university after Year 12, so Sally could save the over $20,000 annual fees charged to attend King's College.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Dillon Dot ===<br/><br/>Jaime started her personal style blog Dillon Dot in 2015 after having gained a considerable Instagram following.
