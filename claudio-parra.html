            Claudio Parra Pizarro (born 14 September 1945) is a Chilean musician, pianist, and composer. He is one of the founders of Chilean rock band Los Jaivas. He is an undisputed referent of the piano with a properly Chilean sound, and considered one of the most important in the history of popular music in Chile.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Claudio is part of the Parra family of Viña del Mar, they are distant relatives of the Parra clan, from where Violeta Parra, Nicanor Parra and Roberto Parra, among others, emerged. Claudio became friends with Gato Alquinta at school, their friendship later led to the creation of the band.<br/><br/>The formal approach to music occurs under the influence of two family members: his uncle Ramón Parra Román ("Uncle Moncho"), who had been a talented classical piano soloist. And his aunt Gladys, who took him along with his brother, Eduardo, to concerts by the Chilean Symphony Orchestra and to presentations of the great Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau. Between the ages of eight and twelve, and thanks to these influences, Claudio began to cultivate classical music techniques.<br/><br/>When The High &amp; Bass –the original name of Los Jaivas– was formed, Claudio's job was to play the accordion. Convinced by a professor at the Federico Santa María Technical University while studying engineering in 1965, Claudio decides to drop out, travel to Santiago and apply to the Conservatory of the University of Chile.
