            2Xtreme Racing is a monster truck owns a National Touring show called the 2 X Monster Truck Live Tour, executing and performing at over 45 shows per year.  Trucks include Bounty Hunter, Scarlet Bandit and five finger death punch inspired Knuckle Head, Hot Tamale, and newcomer Brutal, all of which compete at the various events on the annual schedule.  The team is owned by Jimmy Creten, the two time Monster Jam World Champion and includes Creten, his wife Dawn Creten, who is the longest running female driver in the monster truck industry, Michael Brister, and Rob Poutre and more. Each truck features a different theme, with the headliners featuring an old west theme with a character based on the truck's name. All three vehicles have competed in the Monster Jam World Finals, and Bounty Hunter was the 2005 World Finals Freestyle Champion and the 2019 World Finals Racing Champion. Jimmy Creten and Trent Montgomery currently drive the two Bounty Hunter trucks, Dawn Creten drives the Scarlet Bandit truck, and Todd Morey drives Iron Outlaw.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>After attending a show in the Kingdome in 1995, Creten bought the "Shark Attack" monster truck and renamed it Bounty Hunter without knowing a truck with the same name, owned by Brian Bellini, already existed.  After several years with the truck, he added a second truck named "2Xtreme", which would be driven by his wife, Dawn. While Bounty Hunter had a Chevy S-10 body on a custom chassis, 2Xtreme was a Dodge Dakota on a Dan Patrick built chassis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Through a series of displays for the company, CSK became an official sponsor of the team in 2000.
