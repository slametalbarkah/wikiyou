            The four-leaf clover is a rare mutation of the common three-leaf clover that has four leaflets instead of three. According to traditional sayings, such clovers bring good luck, a belief that dates back to at least the 17th century. The earliest example of this idea may be from the 1620 play Astologaster, by Sir John Melton. The 1640 Theatrum Botanicum mentions a "fower-leafed or purple grasse" that was kept in gardens because it was "good for the purples in children or others".<br/><br/>The term four-leaf is botanically a misnomer, as cloverplants have multiple leaves (multiple clovers), each consisting of a varying number of leaflets, typically three.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Occurrence ==<br/><br/>A 2017 survey of approximately 5.7 million clovers in six European countries found the frequency of 4-leaf clovers to be around 5000 to 1 (one 4-leaf clover for every 5076 normal 3-leaf clovers), almost twice the commonly stated probability of 10,000 to 1. According to this survey, the frequency of a 5-leaf clover is 24,390 to 1, and that of a 6-leaf clover is 312,500 to 1.<br/><br/><br/><br/>According to Guinness World Records, the clover with the most leaflets ever found had 63 of them, and was discovered by Yoshiharu Watanabe of Nasushiobara city, Tochigi prefecture, Japan, on 2 August 2023. The clover was from the species Trifolium repens L., or the white clover; beating the previous record, a 56-leaf clover (of the same species) found by Shigeo Obara of Hanamaki city, Iwate prefecture, Japan, on 10 May 2009. Both men obtained clovers with such a number of leafleats through crossbreeding clover plants with a high rate of clovers with an abnormal number of leaflets, causing that, on average, cloverplants generated clovers with a higher and higher number of leaflets in each generation.
