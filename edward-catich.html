            Edward M. Catich (January 4 1906 – April 13, 1979) was an American Roman Catholic priest, teacher, and calligrapher. He is noted for the fullest development of the thesis that the inscribed Roman square capitals of the Augustan age and afterward owed their form (and their characteristic serifs) wholly to the use of the flat brush, rather than to the exigencies of the chisel or other stone cutting tools.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>After his father's death when he was aged 12, Catich and three brothers (including his twin) were taken by train to the orphanage of the Loyal Order of Moose, the Mooseheart campus near Aurora, Illinois. His step-mother Madeline Catich died in 1927.<br/><br/>At the orphanage he apprenticed under sign-writer Walter Heberling. After graduating high school in 1924, Catich toured with a Mooseheart band, and then went to Chicago, where he played music in bands. Catich studied art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1926–29, and supported himself as a union sign-writer. Catich attended  where he worked as the leader of the school band. He received a master's degree in art at University of Iowa in Iowa City.<br/><br/>In 1935, Catich traveled to Rome to study at Pontifical Gregorian University for the Catholic priesthood, where he also made a study of archaeology and paleography.
