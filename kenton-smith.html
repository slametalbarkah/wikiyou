            Kenton Smith (born September 10, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Smith began playing at major junior level for the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1995–96.  He competed for the Hitmen for five seasons, establishing himself as a cornerstone of the team during that time.  In 1998–99, he recorded 19 goals to establish a single-season team record by a defenceman (surpassed by Paul Postma's 23 goals in 2008–09), en route to leading his team to a President's Cup as WHL champions in 1999.  Smith played 386 games in total for the Hitmen, scoring 226 points and clocking 527 penalty minutes.<br/><br/>Smith began his professional career in 2000, splitting the season between the ill-fated Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League (IHL) and the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL.  In his 13-game spell with the Chiefs, Smith helped them into the post season, when he himself featured on four occasions.  His brief but promising showing with the Chiefs ensured his return to the ECHL the following season, although for the Pensacola Ice Pilots.<br/><br/>Smith impressed for the Ice Pilots as well, and was rewarded with a call up to the American Hockey League (AHL) from the Springfield Falcons.  He featured in 9 AHL games before returning to play at ECHL standard.  For the 2002-03 season, Smith became a Charlotte Checkers player, and again showed his ability at ECHL level, scoring 22 points in 48 games.
