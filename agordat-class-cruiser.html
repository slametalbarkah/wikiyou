            The Agordat class was a pair of torpedo cruisers built by the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the late 1890s. The two ships, Agordat and Coatit, were armed with twelve 76 mm (3 in) guns and two 450 mm (17.7 in) torpedo tubes. They proved to be too slow and have too short a cruising radius to be of much use, so their service careers were limited. Their most significant action came during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, where both ships were employed in shore bombardment duties. Neither ship saw action in World War I. Coatit was converted into a minelayer in 1919 and sold for scrapping the following year, while Agordat was rearmed as a gunboat in 1921; she followed her sister to the breakers in 1923.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design ==<br/><br/>The design for the Agordat class was prepared by Engineering Director Nabor Soliani, who intended to build a pair of ships that could be used as fleet scouts. The new vessels were broadly similar to the previous Partenope class, but they were significantly larger, having a displacement around fifty percent greater than the earlier ships. Soliani also discarded the medium-caliber guns adopted in the Partenope-class ships, reducing the gun battery to light 76-millimeter (3 in) guns. The ships proved to be slow and short-ranged in service. They were only marginally faster than the contemporary pre-dreadnought battleship design, the Regina Margherita class, which limited their utility as fleet scouts.
