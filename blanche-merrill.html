            Blanche L. Merrill  (born Blanche V. Dreyfoos; July 22/23, 1883 – October 5, 1966) was a songwriter specializing in tailoring her characterizations to specific performers. She is best known for the songs she wrote for Fanny Brice.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Biographical information on Blanche Merrill is scarce. The only reference source that provides even a tiny bit of biographical information is partially questionable. This biography had to be constructed primarily from notices appearing in Variety and Billboard. These also must be read critically.<br/><br/>Blanche V. Dreyfoos was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Sigmund A. Dreyfoos (1855 – January 12, 1899), a bookkeeper, and his wife, Lizzie (born Catherine Elizabeth Murphy; January 6, 1860 – January 17, 1921).) Although most sources are in agreement with the date of Blanche's birth (July 23), many provide conflicting evidence with regard to the year.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The 1892 New York State census dated February 16, 1892, indicates that Blanche was 8 years old, making her born in 1883;<br/><br/>In the 1920 U.S. Federal census, her age is listed as 25, making her born in 1895;<br/><br/>According to the ASCAP Biographical Dictionary (based on her membership form filled when she became a member in 1936), she was born July 23, 1895. The ASCAP source was used by the Library of Congress in establishing her date of birth.<br/><br/>According to the 1940 U.S. Census she was born in 1900.
