            Ilias Tsirimokos (Greek: Ηλίας Τσιριμώκος, 26 April 1907 – 13 July 1968) was a Greek politician who served as Prime Minister of Greece for a very brief period (from 20 August 1965 to 17 September 1965).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>He was born in Lamia in 1907. His father, Ioannis Tsirimokos, was also of a political background. Tsirimokos got involved in politics from a young age and was first elected to parliament in 1936 on the Liberal Party's ticket. During the Axis Occupation of Greece, he co-founded a small leftist party, the Union of People's Democracy (ELD). He served as its general secretary, while the distinguished law professor Alexandros Svolos served as its president. In 1941, ELD joined the National Liberation Front (EAM), and Tsirimokos gained a seat in EAM's central committee. In 1944, Tsirimokos was appointed as Secretary for Justice in the EAM-controlled Political Committee of National Liberation. However he resigned from that position on 2 December 1944 alongside 3 other left-wing cabinet members after pressure from the British Government.<br/><br/>In the 1950 elections, after the Greek Civil War, Tsirimokos was elected again into parliament, for Athens, on behalf of the renamed Socialist Party-Union of People's Democracy (SK-ELD).
