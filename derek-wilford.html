<h1>Derek Wilford</h1>
            
            Colonel Derek Wilford OBE (16 February 1933 – 24 November 2023) was a British Army officer who commanded the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment.<br/><br/>In Derry, Northern Ireland on Bloody Sunday he was in command when soldiers within his battalion shot 26 unarmed civilian protesters, killing 13 of them. At the time he was a lieutenant colonel. The following year he was awarded the OBE by Queen Elizabeth II, widely seen as a reward for his part in Bloody Sunday. The Saville Inquiry into the incident found that he had ignored orders, without justification, and in doing so had "set in train" the shootings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Northern Ireland ==<br/><br/>Wilford was exonerated by the Widgery tribunal that April and on 3 October 1972 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). This act was widely interpreted as both a reward for his part in Bloody Sunday and a gesture of solidarity for him by the British establishment. However, the Saville Inquiry, many years later, determined that Wilford had expressly disobeyed an order from a superior officer, Brigadier Pat MacLellan, who prohibited Wilford from sending troops into the Bogside. The Saville Inquiry found that MacLellan was not to blame for the shootings. Lord Saville said Colonel Wilford was wrong to send soldiers into an unfamiliar area where there was a risk of attack from Irish republican paramilitaries, in circumstances where the soldiers' response would risk civilians being killed or injured.
