            Erhard Altdorfer (sometimes Erhart Aldorfer) (c. 1480–1561) was a German Early Renaissance printmaker, painter, and architect, who worked as a court painter in Schwerin from 1512 until his death in 1561.<br/><br/>Erhard Altdorfer was the younger brother of Albrecht Altdorfer.  Most likely, he was trained by his brother, and it is believed they started a workshop together in 1506.<br/><br/>It is assumed Erhard Altdorfer worked in Austria at the Lambach Abbey, and in St Florian and Klosterneuburg around 1510.  In 1512, he went to Schwerin, where Duke Henry V of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1479–1552) appointed him court painter and architect.  During a trip with the duke that year, he probably came in contact with Lucas Cranach the Elder.  A commission for the duke and Albert VII was an altarpiece in Sternberg, however, destroyed by fire in 1741.<br/><br/>In 1533–34 his woodcuts appeared in Johannes Bugenhagen's Low German translation of the Bible printed in Lübeck by the printer and bookmaker Ludwig Dietz (–1559), a work for which he was rewarded with a house.  <br/><br/>Between 1546 and 1551, further construction projects were realized, projects of which remains virtually no traces, why one can have only vague ideas of their character.
