            A carrier battle group (CVBG) is a naval fleet consisting of an aircraft carrier capital ship and its large number of escorts, together defining the group. The CV in CVBG (Cruiser Voler) is the United States Navy hull classification code for an aircraft carrier.<br/><br/>The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II.  The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was the first to assemble many carriers into a single task force, known as the Kido Butai.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  The Kido Butai operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the Battle of Midway.  In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts.  These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the Battle of the Coral Sea and Midway.  By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers.  These groups eventually formed the Fast Carrier Task Force, which became the primary battle unit of the U.S. Third and Fifth Fleets.<br/><br/>With the construction of the large "supercarriers" of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived.
