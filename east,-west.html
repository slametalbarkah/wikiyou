            East, West (ISBN 0-394-28150-0) is a 1994 anthology of short stories by Salman Rushdie. The book is divided into three main sections, entitled "East", "West", and "East, West", each section containing stories from their respective geographical areas (in the "East, West" section both worlds are influenced by each other). Though Rushdie himself never divulged the exact inspirations for his stories in East, West, it is commonly thought that the central themes of each of his stories are drawn from his personal experiences as an immigrant in England during the time of the fatwas issued against his life.  Rushdie weaves in many pop cultural references into his stories, just as television and Western media such as MTV and movies like Rambo have become popular throughout the world and on the Indian subcontinent. The influence and travels of Indians and Indian culture is also shown in the West.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Contents ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== East ===<br/><br/>Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies - A young woman attends the Consulate so she may join her husband from an arranged marriage in England, only to derail her interview with incorrect answers, in order to remain in India as an independent woman.<br/><br/>The Free Radio - Examines government attempts during the State of Emergency to address high birth rates with sterilisation of poor men.<br/><br/>The Prophet's Hair - A moneylender is driven mad after finding a stolen lock of the Prophet's hair.
