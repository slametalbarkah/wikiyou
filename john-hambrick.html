<h1>John Hambrick</h1>
            
            John James Hambrick  (June 21, 1940 – September 10, 2013) was an American broadcast journalist, reporter, actor, voice over announcer and TV documentary producer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Broadcast journalist ===<br/><br/>Hambrick began his television career in 1963 at KRBC-TV in Abilene, Texas; this was followed by stints as a reporter and anchor at KFDX-TV in Wichita Falls and KHOU-TV in Houston over the next two years. In 1966 he took an anchoring job at WCPO-TV in Cincinnati and, after less than two years there he was recruited by its sister station in Cleveland, WEWS, to become its main news anchor.  With much fanfare on December 25, 1967, 27-year-old Hambrick made his Cleveland television debut on WEWS as anchor of the 7:00 and 11:00 P.M. newscasts, which included commentaries by Dorothy Fuldheim. A full promotional advertisement was printed in both The Plain Dealer and the Cleveland Press newspapers.<br/><br/>In 1970, Dave Patterson joined Hambrick as co-anchor, with Fuldheim continuing as commentator; they would help station's news broadcast maintain the position as Cleveland's top television news program in the local Nielsen ratings, to where it had risen during Hambrick's tenure. Hambrick then departed for KABC-TV in Los Angeles in September 1975, and Ted Henry joined Patterson as co-anchor.<br/><br/>After two years as news director and 5:00 and 11:00 P.M. co-anchor on KABC-TV, Hambrick moved on to anchor for three years at KRON-TV in San Francisco.  In January 1980 he joined WNBC-TV in New York City as first a reporter and weekend anchor, then weeknight co-anchor alongside Chuck Scarborough for the next five years.<br/><br/>In spring 1985, WNBC-TV chose not to renew Hambrick's contract.
