            H.E.R.O. is an American comic book series published by DC Comics that started in 2003 and ran for 22 issues. The series was written by Will Pfeifer. Artists included Kano, Leonard Kirk, Patrick Gleason and Dale Eaglesham.<br/><br/>The series' focus was the "H-Dial" that DC had first introduced in "Dial H for Hero" in House of Mystery in the 1960s. For this series the Dial was depicted as an object with buttons instead of a dial and was referred to as the H-Device.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Story arcs and characters ==<br/><br/>Unlike earlier stories, H.E.R.O. did not have one or two protagonists being turned into a new hero every issue, but showed the H-Device passing from bearer to bearer, examining how different people react to the sudden gift of supernatural powers. There was a subplot involving Robby Reed (the main character from the original Dial H for Hero) that ran through most issues and led to the series' final storyline as he tries to find the H-Device.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Issue #1–4: Jerry Feldon, a minimum wage earner from the fictional city of Heaton, Pennsylvania, works as an ice cream vendor and soda jerk. He uses the H-Device in order to impress a co-worker named Molly. His superhero work was unsuccessful with the bad guys getting badly hurt.
