            The IPT-16 Surubim was a Brazilian single-seat, single engined experimental light aircraft. A single example was built and flown in 1959.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design and development ==<br/><br/>In 1949, Joseph Kovács, a Hungarian-born aircraft engineer working at the Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas (IPT - Institute of Technical Research) of the University of São Paulo proposed to design and build an experimental high performance light aircraft powered by a surplus Hirth HM 506 engine that had been imported into Brazil before the Second World War for use in an unbuilt aircraft design. The IPT, however, was busy on other projects, and so did not back Kovács' proposed design. Kovács, with fellow IPT engineer Sylvio de Oliveira, started construction of the design, named "Surubim" (little devil), in a rented workshop.<br/><br/>The Surubim was a low-winged monoplane with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage of all wooden construction with plywood skinning, using Brazilian Pine and Freijo, two indigenous woods. The wings were fitted with trailing edge flaps and fixed leading edge slots. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit.<br/><br/>When Kovács left IPT in 1951, de Oliveira continued work on the prototype, which was acquired by the IPT in 1953 for use as a flying test bed, gaining the designation IPT-16. Construction of the prototype continued at a slow pace, with the prototype being shown at an exhibition in São Paulo in 1956, but remained unflown for several more years.
