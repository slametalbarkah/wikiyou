            Jeremy Michael London (born November 7, 1972) is an American actor. He is best known for his regular roles on Party of Five, 7th Heaven, and I'll Fly Away, a starring role in the 1995 comedy film Mallrats, as well as a notable supporting role in the Civil War epic Gods and Generals. London made his directorial debut with the 2013 horror film The Devil's Dozen, in which he also appeared.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>London was born in San Diego, California, the son of Debbie (née Osborn), a waitress, and Frank London, a sheet metal worker. He was raised mainly in DeSoto, Texas. After having divorced Jeremy's father, his mother moved the family 13 times in six years. His identical twin brother, Jason, is older by 27 minutes and is also an actor. Jeremy has worked mostly in television while Jason has opted for a career in feature films. The two have acted alongside each other only once – in the February 3, 2003, episode of the WB's 7th Heaven, entitled "Smoking." They have also competed for the same role – Jeremy's first audition was for a part in the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, which Jason won, leaving Jeremy the part of his brother's stunt double.<br/><br/>The twin boys had a younger sister, Dedra, who was also an actor.
