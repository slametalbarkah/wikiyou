            The club throw is an athletic throwing event where the objective is to throw a wooden club. The event is one of the four throwing events, along with discus, javelin and shot put of the Summer Paralympics. It is the Paralympic equivalent of the hammer throw. The club throw was introduced for both men and women at the first 1960 Summer Paralympic Games. It was dropped from the women's programme from the 1992 Paralympics in Barcelona but was reinstated for London 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Sport rules ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like other throwing events, the competition is decided by who can throw the club the farthest, though when the event is contested by athletes of different disability classifications, such as the Paralympics, the result is decided by a points score using the Raza Points System which considers athletes' relative levels of disability. The club for men and women weighs a minimum of 397 grams (14.0 oz) and is normally made from wood with a metal base. The athlete sits in a frame in a throwing area which is within a marked circle between 2.135 and 2.50 metres (7 ft 0 in and 8 ft 2 in) in diameter. The frame is common for each competitor and is rigid. The sport is contested at the Paralympics by athletes in the F31, F32 and F51 classes (individuals with the most significant impairment in hand function).
