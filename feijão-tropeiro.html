            Feijão tropeiro, also known as feijão caipira, feijão de preguiça and feijão das onze, is a typical dish from Paulista cuisine. It consists of beans mixed with cassava or maize flour, sausage, eggs, bacon or toucinho, seasoned with garlic, onion, parsley and peppercorn, and is sometimes enriched with chicharrón and brassica oleracea. Initially, the most common way of cooking it was in an improvised trempe, as it was prepared on expeditions to the backlands by bandeirantes and later by tropeiros. It would become a traditional dish in the region explored by bandeirantes and tropeiros. As well as São Paulo, today it is also present in the traditional cuisine of Goiás, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso and Paraná.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origins ===<br/><br/>The dish has its origins in the 17th century. Its name comes from the tropeiros – merchants who sold horses, mules, and food between the south and southeast regions of Brazil. The typical dish were originally created before tropeiros, during the time of the bandeirantes, a pioneering movement originating in São Paulo, responsible for exploring the South America during Brazil's colonial period. <br/><br/>From the 17th to the 18th century, beans, treated as a staple food, cost six times less than rice in São Paulo, and their low cost and durability helped make them part of the explorers' expeditions. It was cooked with bacon and salt; once ready, it was customary to mix it with corn flour until it formed a paste.
