            Daniel Frank Walls FRS (13 September 1942 – 12 May 1999) was a New Zealand theoretical physicist specialising in quantum optics.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>Walls gained a BSc in physics and mathematics and a first class honours MSc in physics at the University of Auckland. He then went to Harvard University as a Fulbright Scholar, obtaining his PhD in 1969. He was supervised by Roy J. Glauber who was later awarded a Nobel prize in 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career and research ==<br/><br/>After holding postdoctoral research positions in Auckland and Stuttgart, Walls became a senior lecturer in physics at the University of Waikato in 1972, where he became professor in 1980. Together with his colleague Crispin Gardiner, during the next 25 years he established a major research centre for theoretical quantum optics in New Zealand and built active and productive collaborations with groups throughout the world.<br/><br/>In 1987 he moved to the University of Auckland as professor of theoretical physics.<br/><br/>His major research interests centred on the interaction and similarities between light and atoms.  He was notable for his wide-ranging expertise in relating theory to experiment, and was involved in all major efforts to understand non-classical light.  A seminal paper by Walls with his first graduate student Howard Carmichael, showed how to create antibunched light, in which photons arrive at regular intervals, rather than randomly.
