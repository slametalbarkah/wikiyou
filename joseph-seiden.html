            Joseph Seiden (יוסף זײדען; 1892–1974) was a pioneering American Yiddish language film producer of the early twentieth century. He released a large number of low-budget, sentimental Yiddish dramas during the 1930s and 1940s. He also directed Paradise in Harlem, a 1940 musical film with an African American cast.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life ===<br/><br/>Seiden was born on July 23, 1892, in Manhattan. His father, Frank Seiden, a Jewish entertainer born in Galicia, Austria-Hungary, was at that time a working magician who ran a bar in the Bowery. While Joseph was still a child, his father became one of the first Yiddish language recording artists in the United States, recording comedy and music records at the turn of the century.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Career in film ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Projection and camera work ====<br/><br/>Seiden was present at the very dawn of the film industry in the New York area as he was a picture operator and voiceover actor at age 15 for the vaudeville and Nickelodeon theaters his family ran, starting in around 1907 with a theater in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and in 1914 the Willott Street Theater in the Lower East Side. The comedian George Burns worked in the Columbia street theater as a child and described it in his memoir as a noisy place where the adjacent Billiards hall often drowned out the act. By 1916 the family moved from running theatres to founding a production company, with Joseph and his brother Jacob being on the board of the Teeaness Film Co., and in 1918 his own company, Seiden Films, which made short educational or industrial films. Joseph soon became a successful cameraman, working for the New York Motion Picture Company, World Film Company, Equitable, and Fox Film.
