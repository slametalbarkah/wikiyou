            Lien Chan (Chinese: 連戰; born August 27, 1936) is a Taiwanese political scientist and politician. He was the chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government from 1990 to 1993, premier of the Republic of China from 1993 to 1997, vice president of the Republic of China from 1996 to 2000, and was the chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) from 2000 to 2005, apart from various ministerial posts he had also held. <br/><br/>After graduating from National Taiwan University, Lien earned a master's degree and his PhD from the University of Chicago in the United States. He ran for the President of the Republic of China on behalf of the Kuomintang twice in 2000 and 2004, but both lost to Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Upon his retirement as KMT Chairman in August 2005, he was given the title Honorary Chairman of KMT.<br/><br/>Lien is highly credited after holding a groundbreaking visit to mainland China in his capacity as the Chairman of the Kuomintang to meet with the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Hu Jintao on April 29, 2005, the first meeting between the two party leaders after the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, which subsequently helped thaw the long-stalled cross-strait relations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lien Chan was born at Jenkins and Robertson Hospital in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, China as the only child of Taiwanese father Lien Chen-tung and mainland Chinese mother Chao Lan-k'un (趙蘭坤). His paternal grandfather, Lien Heng, was the writer of The General History of Taiwan (臺灣通史), a book that is often cited for the quote, "Taiwan's sorrow is that it has no history."His father, Lien Chen-tung, served as Minister of the Interior from 1960 to 1966, promoting local autonomy and maintaining close ties with the CC Clique. His mother, Zhao Lankun, came from a prominent family in Shenyang and had Manchu ancestry. She graduated from Yenching University.<br/><br/>Lien earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the National Taiwan University in 1957 and then pursued graduate studies in the United States, where he earned a Master of Arts in 1961 in international law and diplomacy and a Ph.D. in political science in 1965, both from from the University of Chicago.
