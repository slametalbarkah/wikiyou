            The Cuocolo Trial was a trial against the Camorra, a Mafia-type organisation in the region of Campania and its capital Naples in Italy. The court hearing began in Viterbo on 11 March 1911 and the verdict was delivered on 8 July 1912. The trial was ostensibly to prosecute those charged with the murder of the Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife in 1906. The main investigator, Carabinieri Captain Carlo Fabbroni, transformed the trial into one against the Camorra as a whole, intending to use it to strike the final blow to the criminal organisation. <br/><br/>After 17 months, the proceedings ended with a guilty verdict on 8 July 1912 against the 47 defendants that included 27 leading Camorra associates. They were sentenced to a total of 354 years' imprisonment. Enrico Alfano, the main defendant and alleged head of the Camorra, was sentenced to 30 years. The often tumultuous and spectacular trial attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy as well as in the United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. In 1927, the main incriminating witness retracted his version of the facts, but Italy's dictatorial Prime Minister Benito Mussolini did not authorise the revision of the trial.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The Cuocolo murder ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife, Maria Cutinelli, were murdered on 6 June 1906, suspected of being police informers, and opposing the Camorra leadership.
