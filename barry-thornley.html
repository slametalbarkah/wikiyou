<h1>Barry Thornley</h1>
            
            Barry Edward Thornley (born 11 February 1948) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a winger and full back in the Football League for Brentford and Oxford United. He later made over 200 appearances in a four-year spell at Chelmsford City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Gravesend &amp; Northfleet ===<br/><br/>A left winger, Thornley began his career at hometown Southern League First Division club Gravesend &amp; Northfleet. He made 18 appearances and scored three goals during the 1964–65 season, before departing in October 1965.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Brentford ===<br/><br/>In October 1965, Thornley moved to the Football League to sign for Third Division strugglers Brentford for a £2,000 fee. He initially played for the reserve team and was the first substitute to be utilised for the team, when he replaced Phil Basey in a Combination Cup tie against Bristol City that month.  Thornley had failed to make a first team appearance at all during the 1966–67 season and instead played for the reserves, experiencing some joy by winning the London Challenge Cup with the club. He managed just seven first team appearances for the financially stricken club and was released at the end of the 1966–67 season.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Oxford United ===<br/><br/>Thornley joined Third Division club Oxford United in June 1967. He made something of a breakthrough into the first team, making 19 appearances, scoring three goals and winning silverware, with the Us securing promotion to Second Division by winning the Third Division title.
