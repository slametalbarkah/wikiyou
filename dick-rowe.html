            Richard Paul Brutton Rowe (9 June 1921 – 6 June 1986) was a British music executive and record producer.  He was head of A&amp;R (Singles) at Decca Records from the 1950s to the 1970s, and produced many top-selling records during that period. Known as, "the man with the golden ear,"  Rowe discovered and signed The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Tom Jones, Cat Stevens, The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, The Animals and Engelbert Humperdinck amongst others. Known as being artist friendly and a true music lover he always wanted the best for talent sometimes putting him at odds with upper management. <br/><br/>He is historically presented in popular music history as the man who did not sign The Beatles. In Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography, Rowe is quoted as having rejected them with the words: "Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr. Epstein", although he denied ever having said this. He later signed the Rolling Stones after their audition, thanks to an introduction and encouragement from George Harrison.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and career ==<br/><br/>Rowe was born in London. He joined the A&amp;R department at Decca in 1948, where his responsibilities were to both discover and produce records by new talents.
