            Charis Ursula Frankenburg (née Barnett; 9 February 1892 – 5 April 1985) was a British author, one of the first women eligible for a degree from the University of Oxford, a founder of one of the first birth control clinics in England outside London, and a member of The Mutual Admiration Society.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Charis Barnett was born on 9 February 1892 in Isleworth, London, the daughter of British educator Percy Barnett and his wife, Annie (née Beeching). After attending Bedales School, near Petersfield, and St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, she began her studies at Somerville College, Oxford in 1912, where she met Dorothy L. Sayers and Muriel Jaeger, but was prevented from completing them by the outbreak of World War I. Instead she became a midwife and nurse, and worked in the maternity hospital of Châlons-sur-Marne. She was awarded a "war degree" from Oxford.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Charity activities ==<br/><br/>On 19 February 1918, she married Sydney Solomon Frankenburg (1881–1935), an army captain who was her cousin. They had four children. After they moved to near Salford, in the north-west of England, where his family business was located, Charis Frankenburg took up various local charitable roles. She became particularly active in the field of maternity care, focusing at first on the importance of midwives who had received adequate training. In 1922 she published Common Sense in the Nursery. She became interested in educating working-class women about birth control methods, and in 1926 co-founded the Manchester, Salford and District Mothers' Clinic with her schoolfriend Mary Stocks, after seeking advice from Marie Stopes.
